# Slider component study

This is a study on how to implement a component in:

- vue single-file compoenents
- jquery
- vue (non single-file components)

## Running the project

I assume you hame `parcel-bundler` installed (`npm i -g parcel-bundler`), so you can just:

```sh
parcel index.html
```

You can use any of the `index*.html` pages as entrypoint to see the results.

## Study results

Man, vue is amazing. Hands down the best thing related to front-end development today (after parcel).
I can see me usign the single-file component for complex applications and the other way (similar to how we work with jquery) for everything else... Looking forward for this framework to get as popular as jquery!
